### Important Instructions for SC Students on Applying for Online Scholarship Schemes
Through the Digital Gujarat Portal (https://www.digitalgujarat.gov.in):
1. **First-Time Registration**: Students need to open the Digital Gujarat Portal, select the
“Login” option, click on “Citizen Login/Registration,” then click on “New Registration (Citizen)” to
create a new account. Registration requires an email ID, mobile number, and password, which
students should keep secure for future use. Both email ID and mobile number are mandatory,
as this mobile number will remain associated with the student’s account until the completion of
studies or scholarship benefit duration.
2. **Returning Users**: If a student has already registered on the Digital Gujarat Portal (for
instance, if they applied for a scholarship in a previous academic year, for tablet assistance, or
for any other schemes available through the portal), they do not need to re-register. Instead,
they can log in with their existing credentials (Login ID and Password) and directly apply for
relevant schemes.
3. **Forgotten Password**: If students forget their previous year’s password, they can click on
“Forget Password,” enter their registered mobile number, and receive a One-Time Password
(OTP) to reset their password. Following the reset, the mobile number will be used as the User
ID, and the newly set password will be valid for future logins.
4. **Changing Mobile Number**: If a student’s registered mobile number is lost or deactivated,
they should contact their district’s SC/ST/OBC welfare office to verify their identity and update
their mobile number in their profile.5. **Scholarship Services Access**: Once logged in, students should go to “Services” in the
menu and click on “Scholarship Services” to access and complete the online application

per the guidelines will have their applications automatically moved to "Renewal" mode.
Therefore, these students do not need to submit a new application. By clicking the
"Renewal" button, they must verify and update all details, including Registration Details,
Bank Details, Academic Details, Disability Details (if applicable), and upload required
documents. (Students must scan and upload original documents.)
2. If Renewal Option is Unavailable: If the scholarship was granted in the previous year
but does not appear in "Renewal" mode, students should click "Request a New Service,"
select the financial year 2024-25, choose the applicable scheme, and complete the
application form.

upload a passport-size photo. Upon completion, click "Verify Mobile Number" to receive
an OTP on your mobile. After entering the OTP, click "Final Submit" to submit your
application. Once submitted, the application will be sent to the respective
school/college/institution's login for approval. After submission, students are advised to
print a copy of the application for future reference and submit it along with necessary
documents to their school/college/institution.

1. Application Period: Eligible SC students should apply online through the Digital Gujarat
Portal from October 9, 2024, to November 10, 2024, to receive scholarships or financial
assistance for the academic year 2024-25.
2. Aadhaar-Based Biometric eKYC:
o The Government of Gujarat has mandated Aadhaar-Based Biometric eKYC for all
scholarship applications for 2024-25 under the Post Matric Scholarship
schemes (BCK6.1 - With and Without Freeship Card).
o In coordination with the state’s Civil Supplies Department, Aadhaar-Based
Biometric eKYC is implemented through the Ration Card database to verify
students’ identities online. Separate biometric verification for eKYC is not
required if it is already completed with the Civil Supplies Department.
o How to Complete eKYC:
1. Using the "My Ration" mobile application (Link: My Ration App).
2. Visiting the Civil Supplies section of the Mamlatdar office or the zonal
office of the Municipal Corporation in your area.
3. Completing eKYC at your Gram Panchayat office through a VCE (Village
Computer Entrepreneur).
4. School principals may also assist with this verification.
Students must have their name and Aadhaar number linked to a Ration Card for Aadhaar-Based
Biometric eKYC.
3. Family ID Project:
o Under the Family ID project, students applying for scholarships are required to
provide their Aadhaar number, Ration Card number, and Ration Card Member ID.
When filling out the online application, students should enter their Ration Card
Member ID, and the details will automatically be retrieved from the Ration Card
database via API service.
o School authorities must verify the fetched data and ensure that the eKYC details
belong to the correct student to avoid any errors in scholarship approval.
4. Scholarship Disbursement Process:
o Starting from the academic year 2022-23, the Post Matric Scholarship scheme
distributes funds based on a 40% contribution from the state government and
60% from the central government. All students are required to link their Aadhaar
number with their bank account as the scholarship amount is deposited directly
into their account.
5. Hostel Certificate:o Students residing in hostels should download the Hostel Residence Certificate
from the Digital Gujarat Portal. This certificate must be signed and stamped by
the authorized hostel official and then uploaded during the application process.
o The certificate is available on the “Instruction” page during the application
process.
6. Out-of-State Applications:
o SC students who are permanent residents of Gujarat but studying in recognized
institutions outside the state should also apply through the Digital Gujarat
Portal. After completing the online application, they should submit a copy of all
required documents, including proof of institutional recognition, course
approval, and fee receipt, along with the forwarded letter to the SC Welfare
Office in their home district.
When filling out the “Registration Detail > Current Address State” field in the scholarship form,
students studying outside Gujarat should select a state other than Gujarat.
1. For SC Students with Freeship Card Admission:
o Students who have secured admission under the Freeship Card should apply
only under the scheme "(BCK-6.1) Post Matric Scholarship for SC Students (GOI)
(Freeship Card Students Only)." As per new guidelines from the Government of
India, effective from the academic year 2021-22, the tuition fee will be directly
deposited into the student’s bank account.
o After the scholarship amount is credited to the student’s account, they must pay
the required fee to their college or institution within 7 days. If the student fails to
make the payment within the stipulated time, the respective college/institution
may take necessary action as per regulations. (Students are advised to take note
of this.)
o Students with a Freeship Card who do not apply online and do not receive a
scholarship will be responsible for this oversight.
2. Application Status and Document Submission:
o If a student has submitted the online application but has not completed the final
submission or has not submitted the required documents to their institution,
their application will not be considered.
o It is the student’s responsibility to ensure their bank account complies with the
bank’s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. Scholarship payments are directly
credited to bank accounts linked to the student’s Aadhaar number. If incorrect
bank account details are entered in the form, and the scholarship is credited to
another account, the student will bear full responsibility.
3. Dormant Accounts:o If a student’s bank account has been inactive for an extended period (no
transactions or withdrawals), it may be classified as dormant. Scholarship funds
cannot be credited to dormant accounts. Therefore, students should ensure
their bank account is active to avoid delays in scholarship deposits.
4. Accuracy in Academic Details:
o Students must carefully select their institution and course details. If incorrect
information is provided, the application may be sent to another
school/college/university. Any issues arising from this will be the student's
responsibility.
o If a student cannot find their course details in the selection menu, they should
contact their institution. The institution can add the relevant course under their
login, allowing the student to select it after some time.
5. Application Integrity:
o Any false information provided by the student or documents submitted with
errors will disqualify them from reapplying for scholarships in the future. If a
student attempts to obtain a scholarship through misrepresentation, they may
be blacklisted, and their application rejected. Students are strongly advised to
avoid any attempts at misrepresentation.
6. Avoiding Delays in Application:
o Students should not wait until the deadline to complete their application. They
are encouraged to submit the form in a timely manner, following all instructions
provided by their institution.
7. Academic Year Information:
o Students should obtain the academic year deadline for submission from their
institution. (For annual courses, an annual deadline is required, not semester-
based).
8. Document Submission:
o Students must upload their 10th-grade mark sheet and final-year mark sheets
for all completed courses after 10th grade. These documents must be scanned
and uploaded in their original form and submitted to their institution.
